# Network Automation

The IronCore project provides a robust framework for automating network management tasks. We are leveraging
a Kubernetes-based architecture to streamline the deployment, configuration, and monitoring of network devices.

## Key Features
- **Devices Discovery**: Automatically discover network devices.
- **Provisioning**: Automate the provisioning of network devices.
- **Configuration Management**: Manage and apply configurations across multiple devices.

## Getting Started

In the IronCore project we support different vendors and device types through dedicated operators. Below are some of the key components:

- [network-operator](https://ironcore.dev/network-operator/): Automation for Cisco NX-OS devices.
- [sonic-operator](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/sonic-operator/): Automation for Sonic Edgecore switches.
